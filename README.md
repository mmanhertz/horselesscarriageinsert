# Horseless Carriage Insert

This repository contains the SCAD files I used to 3D print an organizer insert for the board game Horseless Carriage by Splotter Spellen.

The organizer fills the original game box exactly without any lid lift.

Most files are based on and <include> [The Boardgame Insert Toolkit](https://github.com/dppdppd/The-Boardgame-Insert-Toolkit). If you want to modify/render them yourself you'll have to place the file `boardgame_insert_toolkit_lib.2.scad` in the same directory.
